This is a place for learning R with some short - 5 minute - lessons under the Introduction to R Materials heading and to explore data analysis techniques and approaches through practical examples. Under Explorers will be examples and demonstrations where we work through ideas, tools, and approaches that we think may be relevant to EnCompasses work in monitoring, learning, and evaluation.  

**Introduction to R Materials**

This is an introduction to working with the gapminder dataset and a first visualization. <br>

This is an introduction to making a line plot in R. It highlights how to group data before making this kind of plot. <br> 
[How to group data and make a line plot.](https://encompass-worldwide.github.io/Humans-Learning/lesson2_lineplot.html)

Now we take the line plot and introduce facets to show more data cleanly. <br>

**Explorers**

Here's an example that compares two different approaches to sentiment analysis. <br>
