Greetings and welcome to the third iteration of Humans Learning. As a reminder, each lesson is designed as a 5 - 10 minute virtual session conducted for EnCompass staff to expand their skills with data, and the means of learning is the R programming language. Each lesson will have learning objectives, some example code and explanation to demonstrate a technique or skill, and an open code chunk at the end for you to have some fun. This is all in the service of humans learning. Enjoy!

# Learning objectives

For this session, the learning objectives are to:

-   Understand `ggplot`'s facetting function to make multiple plots at once

-   Make a facetted plot

## Install and load packages

In your R script, you will use the `install.packages()` and `library()` functions to install and load the two packages Tidyverse and Gapminder.

Tidyverse provides a suite of compatible data wrangling and visualization tools. The workhorse of data visualization is the `ggplot2` package. With `ggplot2` the sky is the limit! From basic bar plots to animated graphics to interactive charts and tables connected by a common data source, `ggplot2` and its extension packages can do it all. And once again, Gapminder provides a dataset extracted from the global trend data maintained by, https://www.gapminder.org/.

```{r}
#| class-output: pre

#Installs the package on your system.
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "gapminder"))

#load the libraries so you can use them
library(tidyverse)
library(gapminder)

```

## Set up the data

Similar to before, we need to ensure we have the data and that it's in a format that we can use. To look at just the first six rows so you can see the variable names and structure of the data pass `gapminder` to `head()` as in the code below. 

```{r data}
#| class-output: pre

# assign gapminder to df 
# this is required, but it makes life easier
# don't we all want life to be easier

df <- gapminder

# look at the gapminder dataset
head(df)

tail(df)

```

It look pretty clean and tidy. We'll explore some additional options for looking at data sets in the coming weeks.

## Make a facetted plot

We've used `ggplot2` in the previous lessons so this will seem quite familiar. The structure of ggplot requires that we pass it an object (df), the type of `geom_*` we want to make (in this case a line plot), and the aesthetics (the variables we want to plot).

We can start with the plot from lesson two and assign it to the object, `plot`.

```{r plot}

#set up the data like last time
df1 <- df |> 
  group_by(continent, year) |> 
  summarize(avg_gdpPercap = mean(gdpPercap))

#make a plot
plot <- ggplot(df1) +
  geom_line(aes(x = year, y = avg_gdpPercap, color = continent))


```

That gives us the same line plot as last session.

Facetting will separate each of this lines into their own plot panel. You can imagine that if you have lots of data on a single plot, it is easier to see if you can separate visualizations by one of the discrete variables.

Below, the data is separated by continent. Note that the axes across each plot panel are the same which allows for comparison. This is a default of the `facet_wrap()` function. There are cases where you would want to set this feature to false, but in most cases it allows for obvious comparisons across the data.

```{r plot more}

#| class-output: pre


plot +
  facet_wrap(facets = df1$continent)


```

Here's another example that takes the data for one continent and facets it by country. 

First, we do a little data wrangling. Then, we plot.

```{r}

#| class-output: pre

#Filter
df2 <- df |> 
  filter(continent == "Americas") |>
  group_by(country, year) |> 
  summarize(avg_gdpPercap = mean(gdpPercap))


```

::: {.panel-tabset}

## Standard Plot
```{r plot more years}

#| class-output: pre

plot_amer <- ggplot(df2) +
  geom_line(aes(x = year, y = avg_gdpPercap, color = country)) +
  labs(title = "Standard Plot") +
  theme(legend.position = "none")

plot_amer
```

## Facetted Plot

```{r}

plot_amer + 
  facet_wrap(facets = df2$country) +
  labs(title = "Facetted Plot") +
  theme(legend.position = "none"
        , axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, vjust = .5, hjust = 1))



```

## Have fun!

Now it's your turn practice! Below is a fully functioning code editor with starting code in place. Feel free to experiment with different grouping variables in the `group_by()` call or to adjust the summary statistic in `summarize()`. Then, have fun with the plot!

```{webr-r}

library(tidyverse)
library(gapminder)

df <- gapminder

df1 <- df |> 
  group_by(continent, year) |> 
  summarize(avg_gdpPercap = mean(gdpPercap))

ggplot(df1) +
  geom_line(aes(x = year, y = avg_gdpPercap, color = continent))

#now facet this into multiple plots

```
